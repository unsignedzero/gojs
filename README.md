# GO JS #

This code project has two pieces a visual front that is created using
mainly kineticJS and a backend which uses some jQuery. Each end can be used
independently. Together, they allow the user to play Go, currently with
someone else at the same machine. As this is currently a WIP, not all features
that one would except in a GO game are implemented. Please see the [TODO List](#TODO)
for more details.

To run this game on your local system, clone this repo and run start.html.
Included are the necessary libraries to run this. The other HTML files are
incomplete demos.
